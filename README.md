**A WIP Program to edit and create Voting.json files for Eldewrito**

## Known Issues

1. save button triggers multiple times
2. inputs are not checked for errors(not really an issue, but would be a nice feature for a finished package)
3. maps array is editable, but instead just auto fills from specific maps listed in gametypes section.
  (possibly add a toggle option for above feature)
